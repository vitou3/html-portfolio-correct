<h2>This section talk about my hobbies</h2>
<p>I may not look like it, but, I'm a man of culture. I watch alot of anime and hentai. <br/>
I fantasize about woman alot and wanna get laid alot. I also play game and I often rage quit<br/>
and there recently a game called sekiro that is extreamly hard and for some reason i don't <br/>
freak out or rage quit as much as think i would be maybe becuase i knew that this game hard <br/>
and set the expectation low. I don't know. That's it for my hobbies.</p>
<h2>What i want to become in the future.</h2>
<p>So first, In my youth I want to accumulate alot money (7-10k)and make myselft mature,badass,<br/>
sexy as possible. The next step is to find a loyal woman out there with great personality and <br/>
and beautiful and also not cheat on me. Then make her pregnant with my child and build a family.
<br/>then in my late 40 i'll start a business and enjoy it until the old age.</p>
